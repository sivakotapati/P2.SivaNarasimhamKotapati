    <ul>
        <li>All major functionalities like speedometer, tachometer, fuel indicator and warning symbols are included</li>
        <li>Shows time and temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The speedometer and tachometer units are added in between the numbers, making it diffult to identify.</li>
        <li>Speedo meter and tacho meter are clumsy with icons and fuel indicator.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- <img src="images/Example_Dashboard_1.jpg" />
    <p>Pros:</p>

    <p>cons: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No indication to know which is speedometer vs which is tachometer.</li>
        <li>Missing units for speedometer - speed units are unknown weather it's kilometers/hour or miles/hour.</li>
        <li>Too many symbols are packged together - it confuses the user and requires more attention to know the
            warning.</li>
        <li>Missing left and right singal indicators. Even if it was included below the speedometer/tachometer. it is
            not easily visible.</li>
        <li>Repeated icons - car door or trunk opened indicator is repeated many times. They consumed a lot of space.<p>
                For example, one icon for trunk opened, one for front door, and another for front and back doors.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The numbering line marks in speedometer and tachometer are extended out of the respective meter area.</li>
        <li>Only one number (1/2) is added in the fuel indicator.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Not having important icons like head light, engine temperature. Though the icons may apper when used / an
            when there is an issue. Still it causes below issue.</li>
        <li>Icons are spread across 3 areas (in speedometer, tachometer and fuel and other area) user has to get familar
            with which icons will be displayed where</li>

        <li>Speedometer is too much crowded making it difficult to identify speedometer units and the warnings.</li>
        <li>There are two units (MPH at top and km/h at right bottom )showing in the speedometer, difficult to know
            which is correct.</li>

            (between 1 and 2 in tachometer and 20 and 40 in speedometer)
            but the inward curve is used for main range units (1, 20 in tachometer and 20,40 in speedometer.)

        <li>Instead of grouping the fuel indicator meters with in a speedometer, seperate it.</li>
        <li>Keep the speedometer to the left.</li>
        <li>Keep the warning symbols in seperate section.</li>
        <li>Keep the indicator lights on the center of the screen.</li>
